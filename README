The TheoDORE (Theoretical Density, Orbital Relaxation and Exciton analysis) package is a general purpose program suite for the analysis of excited states obtained from quantum chemical excited state calculations.

For more information, go to http://theodore-qc.sourceforge.net/. Please use the discussion forum at https://sourceforge.net/p/theodore-qc/discussion if you have any question.

TheoDORE uses the cclib library (http://cclib.github.io) for some of its file parsing work.
